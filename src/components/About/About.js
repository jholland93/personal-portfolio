          My name is Jason Holland and I am a recent Graduate of Computing &
          Digital Media from Galway-Mayo Institue of Technology. I am a
          competent and hard working individual with an affinity for design.
          Both technology and design have been interests of mine from a young
          age which is why I why I immediately found myself at home with Front
          End Development and Web Design. I am eager to learn and always looking
          to improve my technical skills and understanding.
